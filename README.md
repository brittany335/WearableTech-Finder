# WearableTech Finder (Python 3)

This package finds companys from a specified hashtag posted that day from instagram then scrapes the companys found for an email, bio, and address. It is then displays everything on a webapp.

## Getting Started

To run please open two terminals. In one terminal run the Flask_app.py to get a visual output of the results:
```
python3 Flask_app.py
```
In the other run ExecutesEverything.py. To run ExecutesEverything.py continuously so that the Flask_app.py is frequently updated in terminal run 

```
while :; do python3 ExecutesEverything.py;  sleep 10; done
```
Once those two files are running go to http://127.0.0.1:6039/ to see the site 

### Installation 
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


### Inside ExecutesEverything.py

1) User_post_hashtag.py obtains the usernames that have used the hashtag specified 
2) get_website.py obtains the url to the username from the instagram bio
3) CompanyInfo.py gets company information on the urlâ€™s found in get_website.py by using all these files listed:

          contact_on_contactpage.py
          bar_bones.py
          bio_google.py

4) The CompanyInfo.py results are then stored in a textfile called company_info.txt
5) headless_selenium.py function take a screen shot of each of the urls found in the CompanyInfo.py function
